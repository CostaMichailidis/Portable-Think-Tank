Portable-Think-Tank
===================

A creative thinking tool for generating ideas.

Objectives
==========

**Portable Think Tank** serves to accomplish three things:

1. Help you to generate ideas.
2. Bring novelty to your thinking.
3. Make **Idea Generation** fun and engaging.

How to Use Portable Think Tank
==============================

First, build your **Think Tank**, your group of stellar thinkers or just a group of characters you fancy. Mine's got Aristotle, Lisa Simpson and Bugs Bunny in it. Then, make it **Portable**. Arrange their pictures on a collage and print it out or make it your desktop (or smartphone) background. If you're incredibly short on time or motivation just make a mental picture ; )

Now, you can use your **Portable Think Tank** when you are in the **Idea Generation** stage of problem solving and you'd like to generate more ideas or more novel ideas. As your listing out ideas, just ask yourself, "What would **Bugs Bunny** do?" "What about Winnie the Pooh?" or whoever you have in your **Tank**.

Lastly, feel free to add new members to your **Think Tank** or fire those that don't inspire anymore.
